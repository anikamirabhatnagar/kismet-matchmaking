                        Kismet was founded by Mala, who got tired of watching amazing South Asian women 
                        settle for mediocre matches or stay single because dating apps just don't work 
                        for people like us.

                            Kismet represents the beautiful belief that some connections are meant to be - 
                            that fate and destiny play a role in bringing the right people together at the right time.

                            Mala is that auntie everyone wishes they had - the one who actually listens, gives 
                            amazing advice, and somehow knows everyone worth knowing. She's spent 30+ years 
                            building genuine relationships in the South Asian community, and now she's using 
                            those connections to help you find your person.
